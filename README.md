# This is a test repo for doing git things and making sure they work.



## Recipes

### Push local to remote branch

git push -u origin localname:remotename

### List branches

Remote: git branch -r
Local : git branch


### RN

git push origin local:remote
Then, get on github and set up the PR to develop.

Standard RN formula that TF works from:
- update develop branch `git checkout develop; git pull`
- checkout to proper named branch: `git checkout -b fix/[name from trello card]`
- work, add, commit things
- push branch to remote: `git push origin LOCALNAME:REMOTENAME` ie `git push origin fix/126-additional-changes-to-weekly-mailer`
- create pr to develop branch from pushed branch 





## Notes

I added the notes section in a branch called tls-branch-1.
