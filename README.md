# This is a test repo for doing git things and making sure they work.



## Recipes

### Push local to remote branch

git push -u origin localname:remotename



## Notes

I added the notes section in a branch called tls-branch-1.

This time I'm checking what happens when I change thee name of a remote branch when I push it
from local.
